This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a common runtime error: ZeroDivisionError. The program defines a function that performs division. When the second argument is 0, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError because division by zero is undefined. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error by adding a check to handle the case when the denominator is zero.
